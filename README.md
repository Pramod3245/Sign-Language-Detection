Sign Language Detection
Welcome to the Sign Language Detection project repository! This cutting-edge project employs computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret sign language 
gestures, facilitating real-time communication and enhancing accessibility. Whether you're interested in contributing, exploring pre-trained models, or improving the system, 
this repository is the hub for advancing sign language technology. Get started by following the instructions below.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt. (Currently there is no requirements.txt, if you can add it it will be helpful.)

For the dataset you can create a new folder in the root directory with the name my_data, and within this folder create different folders whose name is same as the alphabet
names and those folders must consist the dataset of different images of the respective alphabet.

Your contributions are valued, and we invite you to join us in making sign language detection more accessible and inclusive!
