# Sign Language Detection

A project to detect and translate sign language gestures into text using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## Overview
This repository contains code for a **Sign Language Detection** system that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to recognize hand gestures and translate them into corresponding text.

The project aims to help bridge the communication gap for people with hearing and speech disabilities by translating sign language gestures into text.

## Features
- **Real-time sign language gesture recognition**.
- Detects individual letters of the sign language alphabet.
- Provides a simple interface to display detected gestures.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for this project.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used for training models.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library to process video streams and capture gestures.
- **Keras**: Neural network API for building the detection model.
- **NumPy**: Library for handling arrays and matrices in Python.
